x = not started
+ = started but not done


=== TODO ===

	x Redo matchmaking to be up-to-date (see below), if there is time and interest.
    
	x Confirm that the gate bug is fixed.	
    
	x MC crash after end of map. MC has been patched, seems to be the mode taking too long to load. Investigate if it can be done quicker.
    
    x Port to ManiaPlanet 4 when MP4 is ready (unable to load content to title atm).
    
    x Spectator numpad keys according to team, not join order. Example:
       -------------
      |   = RED =   |
      | 1. Player 4 |
      | 2. Player 1 |
      | 3. Player 2 |
      |  = BLUE =   |
      | 4. Player 6 |
      | 5. Player 3 |
      | 6. Player 5 |
       -------------
      
    + Specs should be able to see the actual cap procentages for both teams, not just the bars.
    
    + Investigate pass sound muted if the pass happens at phase change (only the phase sound plays).
    
    + Ball carrier widget not reset at pause.
    
    + Phase text shouldn't say what phase it is when paused.
    
    + Update to use ModeShootmania instead of ModeMatchmaking.
    
    + Change included maps.
    
    + Look into RPC changes in MP4!


=== INFO ===
    
    x Matchmaking
      Look at source of a different mode (like elite or battle) to see how they implement it and remake it from scratch.
	  Should be compatible with: http://doc.maniaplanet.com/dedicated-server/matchmaking.html
